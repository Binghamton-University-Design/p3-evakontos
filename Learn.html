			<h2>Today&#x27s largest platforms continue to monopolize and progress by manipulating what people see on social media. Our perception of reality has been altered. The mental development of our post millennial generation has been negatively influenced by social media tremendously. We would like to bring a new perspective of light and a new experience to the world of social media with our positivity-based platform.</h2>

		<h1><q>I have asked 500+ people what they think about social media: 80% said it has a more negative impact, 10% were neutral, and 10% saw more benefits. However, close to 90% said they open social media within the first 5 minutes of waking up every day.</h1>
